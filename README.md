# File Converter

##Overview
This python script allows for the input of a URL from youtube to be inputted and 
converted from video format to audio. The different types of ways to interact 
with this converter are:
1. Inputting only a single video to convert.
2. Inputting a playlist to download; note, this will download each playlist 
separately.
3. Inputting a playlist to download, with a range. For example, there is the 
option to download videos 4-6, 7, and 9 if the user chooses to do so.
4. Inputting a single video with timestamps to separate the audio; again, 
this will create a separate video for each of the timestamps.
